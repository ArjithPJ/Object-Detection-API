The Object Price Detector py file has the all the code required for this Motion Picture Detection and E-Commerce Mapping module

Used the custom trained MobileNetSSD_deploy.caffemodel for Object Detection and included config and weight files in the folder


Object Detection

Used the cv2 and matplotlib modules
A video of the object is given as input and the pre-trained model detects it to the 80 daily objects it has been trained. The 80 objects are mentioned in the Labels.txt
The model detects the object in the video and marks a boundary indicating the object
Similarly, All the objects detected in the video is appended to the 'arr'list.

Then the repetitive values is screened and every unique object is found
Then if there was any person detected in the video  that will be screened from the 'arr' list.
The remaining unique objects are stored in the 'result' list and fed for E-Commerce Mapping

E-Commerce Mapping and User Interface


Used the webbrowser module

The elements in the 'result' array from the Object Detection is input into the for loop to search for them in the e-commerce website.
